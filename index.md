I am going to Cal State Fullerton, I am a computer science major, and I plan to graduate in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 11, part 1
  This lab was one of my favorite labs because it forced me to use a lot of different concepts that we have learned. I created a constructor for the States class, which was very new to me so I am glad that I got to practice this. I also really enjoyed all of the errors I ran into while working on this, because I really like to debug my code. This program would print out the densest state and the sparsest state.

* Lab 6, part 1
  This was also one of my favorite labs because it helped me to practice working with strings, and felt that it was a good refresher. In the lab I also worked on printing error messages when a user input is incorrect or if something is wrong. My program would get the user’s sandwich ingredients and formulate an order if all conditions were met.

* Lab 10, part 1
  This lab was one of my favorite labs because I liked working by myself, and doing all the code on my own. In the lab we worked with vectors, read a text file, and printed data from the text file into vectors. The text file held counties’ names and their population. The program could print a specific county’s population, and could also print the state’s total population.
